#Blackjack!

##Objective
#Practice contional logic including nested conditionals. 
#Use methods to keep our code DRY.

##Instructions
#We are going to build a command line blackjack game.  A player gets dealt
# two cards which have values between 1-11.  After they get dealt two cards
#  you should show them the total score of their cards and ask them if they 
#want to hit or stay. A player is allowed to "hit" up to two times.  After 
#each hit you should ask if they want to hit or stay and display the 
#total value of their cards. If they don't want to hit, and they are not at 21 they lose. 
# Your program should tell them they lose and exit.

#Note:  To take input from the person "playing" the game your program will have 
# to use the Ruby method "gets".

##Challenge
#After successfully completing the previous game 
#(there should be a commit with a working version of this game), 
#alter the game so that a player can "hit" as many times as they want.
